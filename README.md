Never-The-Same Reddit

Have you ever wonered what reddit would be like if all links were always blue, all the time? This is actually one of the most popularly requested features on reddit, and yet until now there hasn't been a single technology that allowed for it. This is because recent improvements to javascript security make it impossible to detect what links a user has visited without writing a browser extension, and even browser extensions require jumping through many hoops to get it to work. 

You might be wonering, if this is such a popular feature request, why doesn't reddit just support it? Of course they could detect what links you are clicking and allow you to choose whether or not you want to see them. We can only speculate, but the reddit developers probably feel that since you can choose not to see links that you've already upvoted or downvoted that their job is done, and they have more important work to do. 

This, however, runs against the grain. The vast majority of internet users don't contribute content. Only a small minority contributes content, which you can easily prove to yourself by looking at the number of upvotes on posts on the front page (a few thousand per post at most) and compare that to the number of people who probably clicked that link - tens to hundreds of thousands or more.

Well, this extension is for the rest of us. I personally up and downvote sparingly. It's incomplete (see the issue tracker), but maybe we can make it into something nice and fancy. If you would like to contribute, please contact me.
